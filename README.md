# Class Rebalancing Service

This service uses `imbalanced-learn` to rebalance a dataset based on a target class, it combines oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling (ENN) to be more generalizable.
In order for the service to work your dataset label column must be called "target".
Finally, avoid having multiple empty lines at the end of the file.

_Check the [related documentation](https://docs.swiss-ai-center.ch/reference/services/class-rebalancing) for more information._
